            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I’m Kaiwen—an internal medicine physician and clinical informatician dedicated to enhancing healthcare through technology. 
                After earning my medical degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China, I moved to the United States for my internal medicine residency at Rochester General Hospital, 
                where I now work as a hospitalist and Clinical Informatics fellow. I’m also pursuing a Master’s in Health Informatics at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
                                
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion lies in improving patient care and clinical workflows through the strategic use of electronic health records, data analytics, 
                and innovative digital solutions. In addition to my clinical and informatics roles, I enjoy mentoring residents and medical students, helping them navigate the evolving landscape of health IT.
            </p>
            
            <p>Outside the hospital, I love exploring new cultures with my partner—collecting recipes and culinary traditions that we recreate at home. We share our space with Duoduo, a beloved companion whose playful nature brings warmth to our lives.
            </p>
