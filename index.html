            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Kaiwen, a dedicated physician specializing in internal medicine and clinical informatics. 
                My medical journey began in Shanghai, China, where I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. 
                Seeking to expand my horizons and expertise, I relocated to the United States to pursue an internal medicine residency at Rochester General Hospital.
                                
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I serve as a hospitalist at Rochester General Hospital and am completing a Clinical Informatics 
                fellowship. I am also pursuing a Master's degree in Health Informatics at the Rochester Institute of Technology. 
                This combination of roles allows me to merge hands-on patient care with the innovative application of technology to 
                improve clinical workflows and patient outcomes. My work focuses on leveraging electronic health records 
                and data analytics to optimize healthcare delivery and support medical teams in providing the highest quality care.
            </p>
            <p> Beyond my professional commitments, I am deeply interested in continuous learning and collaboration
                 within the medical community. I actively mentor residents and medical students, sharing insights
                  on the effective use of health informatics in clinical practice.
            </p>
            <p>Outside of medicine, I have a keen interest in travel and cultural exploration. 
                My partner and I enjoy discovering new places and immersing ourselves in different cultures, 
                often bringing back unique recipes to recreate in our kitchen. 
                At home, we share our lives with Duoduo, a cherished member of our family whose playful 
                nature brings us joy.
            </p>
            <p>I am committed to advancing healthcare delivery through the integration of clinical expertise and technological innovation, 
                and I look forward to contributing to the future of medicine together with you.
            </p>
